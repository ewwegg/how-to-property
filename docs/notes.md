# Notes

phases - MVP to Scale - this might be better phrased as "initial" and "additions"? or something similar - or maybe it's fine

do i need 175+ agents? or do i need an agent for "authentication" and then it selects relevant information within itself

- i guess these agents can be good, because they're complete minimal solutions... the "prompt" should be overarching which can combine them.
